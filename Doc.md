In light of the upcoming presidential elections our group has created a application that caters to the needs of the both the Candidates, News, Voters and possibly the Government. 

Target users
	
 1. Voters
 2. Candidates

  
Using postgresql and tradeoff analytics we plan to create an application that can provide the candidates useful information regarding the current situation he or she is in

PostgreSQL was used to store our user information as well as the different values that are used in our application

Tradeoff analytics was used in obtaining different information based on the raw data that voters provided. Using this feature we were able to extract the information that the our users can use.

Our application will be able to Gather information on the different aspects of an election 

Each voter will need to have a account registered in the system. Using this account we will able to track the different statistical data that the user provides  

Use for Voters

1.Enter your pre-election vote
Voters will be able to enter their pre-election vote

2.View Current Trends 
Will be able to see the different standings based on pre-election 

Use for candidates

For the different Candidates they can acquire these different data from our application in real time 

1.Determining The location of low popularity 
			The candidate Should be able to determine areas where he/she has a low rating using statistical data we should be able to direct the user where he/she should focus campaign 

2.Area Population Count
	  The user should also be able to determine the concentration of people in the area. This would allow the candidate information about the number of votes he or she could be able to acquire in a certain area based on population count

3.Be able to check daily updates on the voters 
	The user will be able to check on the updates on the current standing in specific regions and the total statistics of his/her rating

4.Be able to check on the total budget that the candidate is using 
	The user will be able to check his or her budget spending or remaining budget in the different locations 

Significance of the application

Our application will be able to deliver real time information on the current standing of the different candidates. We will also be able to give the different candidates information on the different areas such as population, votes per location, Budget and daily updates.

Uniqueness

What is different with our application is that is able to gather the current trends and focus points of the votes as well as the different population in different areas . It can gather information about multiple data as well as present you with an informed choice.
